# Autonomous-Navigation-and-Path-planning-on-ROS2-using-Dijkstra-and-SLAM
This is the implementation of an autonomous navigation project using TurtleBot3 in a custom Gazebo world. The project integrates ROS 2 Humble, SLAM Toolbox, and a custom Dijkstra’s algorithm for path planning. The goal is to simulate a robot navigating through a maze-like environment, avoiding obstacles, and reaching its destination efficiently.

# FEATURES
SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping): Generate maps in real-time using SLAM Toolbox.
Custom Gazebo World: A maze world built in Gazebo for simulation.
Custom Path Planning: Implemented Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path in the mapped environment.
ROS 2 Navigation Stack: Used for obstacle avoidance and path following.
Real-time Visualization: RViz is used to visualize the robot, map, and path.
