# Autonomous-Navigation-and-Path-planning-on-ROS2-using-Dijkstra-and-SLAM
This is the implementation of an autonomous navigation project using TurtleBot3 in a custom Gazebo world. The project integrates ROS 2 Humble, SLAM Toolbox, and a custom Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for path planning. The goal is to simulate a robot navigating through a maze-like environment, avoiding obstacles, and reaching its destination efficiently.
